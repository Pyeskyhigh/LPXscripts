## Git and Github

LPXscripts is an Open Source project. It uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](http://github.com/) to handle coordinating maintenance of the site and the publishing of new content and features.

If you need any assistance, check out this [guide to Git](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) and this [guide to Github](https://help.github.com/)

Wait for us.
We try to at least comment on pull requests within one business day.
We may suggest changes.

## Making Changes Locally

We suggest that you always make changes to your fork on a local repository on your system. This makes the testing process for both the script functions and the guide website much simpler. If you are only making documentation changes, then it is acceptable to makes changes using GitHub's online editor.

## Reporting Issues

Raising and reporting issues is an incredible way to contribute to this project. If you find something you think you can improve or you want improved, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/kabirnagral/LPXscripts/issues/new). Read through [existing issues](https://github.com/kabirnagral/LPXscripts/issues) to make sure that you are not raising a new issue that is similar to an issue that already exists. If you have something that is related to an existent issue, you can comment on its thread.
