## Daily Commits

To format this for the majority of our contributors and our international contributor base, the date format will be (DD/MM/YYYY). We apologize in advance to our contributors who use alternative forms of date formats. The dates will be in descending order.

The format for daily commits should be as follows:

A clear and coherent message for whatever was committed. Files edited: List of files edited (it isn't necessary to include markdown files unless there are significant changes).
